<h2>Intel Edison Rapid Prototyping Contest</h2>
<span class="subhead">FALL 2015 (In progress)</span>
 
<h3 class="section-heading">The Problem:</h3>

  <img class="project-image--right" src="/assets/project_images/edison.jpg" alt="">
  <p>We were given $200 to design, build, and test an innovative product that solves a problem. While there are several popular medical alert systems available, often these wearable devices arenâ€™t worn, rendering the alert mechanism useless. One respondent I spoke with had laid on the ground for hours waiting for someone to discover them. The Life Alert pendant had been left in another room.</p>

<h3 class="section-heading">The Team:</h3> 

<p>Our team interdisciplinary team is comprised of two cloud computing engineers, one electrical engineers, one industrial designer, and two human factors engineers.</p> 

<h3 class="section-heading">The Product:</h3> 
<p>We created a medical alert system that detect falls, triggering SMS (text-message) communication to friends and family members based on their proximity to their loved-one who has fallen. Our product will be designed aesthetically while still being comfortable and durable to wear.</p>
<p>My role as a Human Factors Engineer: I collected qualitative and quantitative research through disseminating a survey and conducting one on one interviews. The next step will be testing the first iteration prototype with potential users, and incorporating findings and insights into the final prototype iteration before the close of this competition.</p>
