  <p>I evaluated maserti.us according to Cognitive Engineering design principles. To guide the focus of the evaluation I conducted a short usability test with 5 participants, followed by post task interviews.
  </p>

  <h3 class="section-heading">Findings:</h3>
  <p>Overall the five participants found the menu difficult to navigate for all three tasks: comparing prices of vehicles (most difficult), signing up to test drive a car, and finding the location of a dealership.
  </p>
  <p>
  The biggest issue was that the repetition of content of the main menu did not match up with user expectations and mental models. Items contained very similar and sometimes the exact same subtopics. Additionally the extremely wide horizontal structure (sidebar) of the drop down menu made it hard for users to read menu items and hard for them to control which item was selected.
  </p>
  <h3 class="section-heading">Principles Violated:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Visibility</li>
    <li>Feedback</li>
    <li>Transparency</li>
    <li>Distinguishable Elements (Especially Icons)</li>
    <li>Clear Value Proposition</li>
  </ul>
  <h3 class="section-heading">Recommendations:</h3>
  <p>
  The 'Build and Price' button should not be an emergent feature, and should be renamed so users can recognize what it represents in their own language. The menu-structure needs significant modification, including reducing the number of main menu items and eliminating repeated subtopics. Running a card-sorting study could aid in the process of redesigning the menu structure.
