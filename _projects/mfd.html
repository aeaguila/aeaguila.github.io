  <p> My team of 3 Human Factors Graduate students chose to evaluate an interface that had both hardware and software components: a Multifunction Display (MFD). First we created an ideal test plan and then implemented an abbreviated version, testing 8 participants who ranged in technological skill level and experience using MFDs. For the sake of practicality and safety we ran the study using a primary attention task of identifying white cars on a laptop rather than the participants actually using the MFD while driving.

  <h3 class="section-heading section-heading--over-img">Findings:</h3>

  <p>The mouse was really cumbersome, especially since it was the main way to enter a destination into the navigation system. To boot, the back and delete buttons were poorly distinguished from one another, so sometimes users would accidentally go back clearly their data, when they only meant to delete a single letter. The average time to enter a destination was over 4 minutes!</p>
  <p>Instructions for syncing contacts through bluetooth were unclear and poorly organized; the critical information was camouflaged with extraneous information. Several participants asked if they could google how to do it.
  </p>
  <p>
  Our participants found the interface complex with a menu that was "much too deep." Users lost track of where they were in the system, and struggled to determine what menu items stored the features they were looking for.

  <h3 class="section-heading">Recommendations:</h3>
  <p>
  This multi-function display (MFD) ultimately needs a complete overhaul of the menu structure. The mouse needs to be replaced by a type of different control or even better removed, and make the MFD a touchscreen. While hard controls are nice to have for back and main menu, they should also be located on the MFD, to reduce the gaze distance from the road to the controls.
