I selected 'Handoffs in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU)' for my literature review because while there is a plethora of research on handoffs very little is focused on handoffs in the NICU. Research in this area is critical; these patients are particularly fragile. I extracted handoff strategies applicable to the NICU environment and identified a gap in current Human Factors research.

<p><em>
<strong>Handoffs</strong> are the transfer of patient responsibility from one person or medical group to another. It occurs during admission, discharge, and when medical practitioners change shifts or take a break. Within automation handoffs refer to the transfer of control from a human to a computer or vice versa.
</em></p>
<h3 class="section-heading">Findings:</h3>
<p>The focus of most handoff research is communication, looking not only at what intended meaning is not received (i.e. semantics), but also aspects that influence the way we communicate to others such as social hierarchy within the workplace. Verbal communication takes up a significant portion of handoffs.
</p>
<p>
Currently handoffs are often conducted informally, rather than following a standardized process; however, recently the use of Electronic Medical Record (EMR) integrated tools has been shown to aid in handoff information accuracy specifically in the NICU.
</p>
<h3 class="section-heading">Recommendations:</h3>
<p>
Handoff research outside of the medical setting can prove applicable and valuable to handoffs in the NICU, but we need to carefully identify the what distinguishes the NICU dept from other areas, such as a fairly low staff turnover rate (which can enable more team-building). 
</p>
<p>
Additionally more research is needed into how handoffs in the NICU currently occur, so we can determine the best plan for implementing new strategies, procedures, and technology.
