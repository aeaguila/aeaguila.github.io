  <p>Our team is comprised of three Human Factors Engineering students and one behavioral science student.</p>

  <p>For this project we first we determined our overarching research question:</p>
  <p><strong><em>Is the current transportation system used by students, teachers, and campus staff a sustainable one?</em></strong></p>
  <p class="list-heading">To evaluate this question we conducted:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Participant Observations</li>
    <li>Fourteen Ethnographic Interviews</li>
  </ul>
  <p class="list-heading">Then we:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Used Affinity Diagramming to Identify Preset Codes & Research Gaps</li>
    <li>Conducted interviews to fill the gaps</li>
    <li>Coded all Interviews adding any Emergent Codes</li>
  </ul>
  <p>At this point we are working on the final round of coding, and gleaning insights about our research question that will go into our final report. The findings and recommendations for this project will be updated as soon as it is completed.</p>
