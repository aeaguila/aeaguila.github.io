  <p>
  For this project the goal was redesigning the Craigslist cPro App. We focused on the aspects surrounding buying and selling used items. We conducted a study having users complete searching, buying, and posting tasks and selecting posting as the task flow we’d redesign since it was the most difficult in terms of number of steps and time involved. The design process included several rounds of testing followed by several iterations of prototypes.
  </p>
  <p>The results from the last stages of testing (A/B and cardsorting) and the final redesign will be posted upon completion.</p>
  <p class="list-heading">We conducted:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>A Comparative study (Amongst Craigslist, OfferUp, and eBay)</li>
    <li>A short study looking at Searching, Buying, and Posting</li>
    <li>A round of creating Low-fidelity prototypes </li>
    <li>Transcription of handdrawn sketches to a click through prototype in Axure</li>
  </ul>

  <p class="list-heading">To be completed:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>A/B Testing</li>
    <li>Cardsorting to ensure menu structure matches user mental models</li>
    <li>Final design of Posting flow</li>
  </ul>

  <h3 class="section-heading">Findings (So far):</h3>
  <p>User needs for the search box were not being met. Several users tried to type in ‘Free bookcase’, the results included bookcases that costs hundreds of dollars. The backend search algorithm requires some reengineering.
  </p>
  <p>
  The process for creating an account is time consuming primarily due to inconcise communication and poorly differentiated calls to action. The link to verify email is lost a wordy and unnecessary description. The overuse of red text negates its ability to be an emergent feature.
  </p>
  <p>Users become lost in the huge number of modal menus containing search filters like the city of item location and the category of item. This process needs to become streamlined.</p>
