<h3>About Me...</h3>
<p>I am a researcher, a needs-finder, and a problem-solver. I feed on discoveries that improve lives and make navigating this complex world simpler. This is why I fell in love with user research. Last Fall I started the the Masters Program at SJSU in Human Factors and Ergonomics. This last year I have worked on effective usability testing and analyzing quantitative and qualitative data. I am excited about learning more through projects where I get to be involved in every stage of the design process.</p>
